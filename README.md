# ATM-Function-
This Python ATM class simulation provides a simple yet functional representation of an ATM system. It allows users to manage their PIN, check their balance, and withdraw funds. The program is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, making it a great project for beginners looking to practice their programming skills.
Key Features:

PIN Management: Users can create a new PIN or change their existing PIN.
Balance Checking: Users can check their current balance after entering the correct PIN.
Withdrawal Functionality: Users can withdraw funds from their account, provided they have sufficient balance.
User Interaction: The program runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple transactions until they choose to exit.
Code Overview: The ATM class includes methods for each of the functionalities:
__init__: Initializes the ATM with no PIN and a balance of zero.
menu: Displays the main menu and handles user input.
create_pin: Allows users to set a new PIN and initial balance.
change_pin: Enables users to change their existing PIN.
check_balance: Checks the user's balance after verifying the PIN.
withdrawal: Processes withdrawal requests, ensuring sufficient funds are available.
Usage: To use the ATM simulation, simply run the script. The user will be prompted to create a PIN and set an initial balance. After that, they can navigate through the menu to perform various actions.
This project serves as an excellent introduction to object-oriented programming in Python, demonstrating how to encapsulate functionality within a class and manage user interactions effectively.
Feel free to contribute or modify the code to add more features, such as deposit functionality or transaction history!
